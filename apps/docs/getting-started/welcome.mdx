[Director](https://director.run) is open source MCP middleware that acts as a proxy between models/agents and MCP servers. Supporting all MCP transports natively, it aggregates tools, prompts, and resources server-side while providing a unified client-side integration point. This abstraction eliminates MCP server management overhead, enabling developers to focus on prompt engineering and domain logic rather than infrastructure complexity.

#### Open Source
MIT-licensed with no vendor lock-in. Run locally with zero dependencies, in Docker, or as a cloud service.
#### Centralized Configuration
Eliminate client-side config files and secret management. Create isolated proxies with dedicated connection endpoints.
#### Protocol-Native
Fully MCP-compliant implementation that works with any standard MCP client or server.
#### Flexible Deployment
Install and run locally in one command via npm. Deploy to any *nix server or containerized environment.
#### Built-in Observability
Structured JSON logging for all MCP operations. Stream logs to your existing aggregation tools for production monitoring.
#### Security Features
- VM Isolation: Sandbox MCP servers in VMs or containers to prevent code injection
- OAuth2 Support (coming soon): Automated token management and secure authentication
- Multi-tenancy (coming soon): Transform single-tenant MCP servers into multi-tenant deployments
#### MCP Registry
Discover and evaluate MCP servers securely with built-in isolation. Future releases will enable dynamic server management through MCP tool calls.

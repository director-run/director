The registry is a collection of servers that are available to be used in the Gateway. It is fully [open source](https://github.com/theworkingcompany/director/tree/main/apps/registry) and does not require authentication. We are currently prioritising other parts of director until the official [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) matures.

## Accessing the Registry

The best way to access the registry is in your browser via the [Studio](https://studio.director.run/library). Or alternatively, you can use the [CLI](./cli):

```bash
# List all servers in the registry
director registry ls

# Adding a server from the registry
director add my-proxy --entry google-drive
```


## Adding a server to the Registry

We re-populate the registry on a regular basis from the [seed file](https://github.com/theworkingcompany/director/tree/main/apps/registry/src/seed/entries.ts). If you'd like to add a new entry, please add it to the file and open a PR. Here's an example of an entry:

```js
  {
    name: "google-drive",
    title: "Google Drive",
    description:
      "This MCP server integrates with Google Drive to allow listing, reading, and searching over files.",
    isOfficial: true,
    icon: "public/drive.svg",
    homepage:
      "https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/gdrive",
    transport: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-gdrive"],
      env: {
        GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH: "<gdrive-server-credentials-path>", // user will be prompted for the value on add
      },
    },
  }
```

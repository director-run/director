## Why Director?

Director is a MCP Proxy. Instead of connecting your clients manually to many MCP servers (by edinting the config), you can use the director CLI to connect a single server and then add a bunch of proxies to it. In addition, it provies the following benefits:

- Discovery
- Environment
- Audits
- Security
- Config & Secret management


## Quickstart

*Note: Director is new project under active development and is not yet stable. See CONTRIBUTING.md.*

```shell
# install director
$ npm install -g @openai/codex

# start the server (-d deamonizes)
$ director start -d

# create a new proxy server
$ director proxy:create <PROXY_NAME>

# list available servers
$ director registry:ls

# add a target from the registry 
$ director proxy:target:create <PROXY_ID> <TARGET_NAME>

# install the proxy server to claude
$ director claude:install <PROXY_ID>
```

Director is MCP middleware bridging MCP Clients and Servers. It provides clients a single connection point and aggregates server tools, prompts, and resources - supporting all MCP transports (HTTP Streamable, Stdio, SSE).

Director centralizes MCP configuration and abstracts server management through CLI, Studio (GUI), and SDK interfaces.

# Gateway

The `Gateway` implements a proxy pattern aggregating MCP servers and serving them to clients via standard protocol transports. Additional components:
- `ClientConfigurator`: Automates adding and removing client connections (Claude, Cursor, VSCode) to the `Gateway` without manual JSON configuration
- `Controller`: Exposes HTTP API ([TRPC](https://trpc.io/)) for dynamic `ProxyServer` management

# Gateway Management

The `Gateway` runs as standalone infrastructure (currently locally is the best supported). Director's client/server architecture for management (distinct from MCP client/server connections) enables `ProxyServer` lifecycle management, target configuration, and service health monitoring via the `Controller` layer.

Management interfaces:
- [CLI](../sdk/cli): Primary `Gateway` runtime and management tool (npm installable)
- [Studio](../concepts/studio): Web interface for visual `Gateway` and `ProxyServers` management, ideal for complex deployments

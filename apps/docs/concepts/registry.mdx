The registry is a collection of servers that are available to be used in the Gateway. It is fully [open source](https://github.com/director-run/director/tree/main/apps/registry) and does not require authentication. We are currently prioritising other parts of director until the official [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) matures.

## Accessing the Registry

The best way to access the registry is in your browser via the [Studio](https://studio.director.run/library). Or alternatively, you can use the [CLI](./cli):

```bash
# List all servers in the registry
director registry ls

# Adding a server from the registry
director add my-proxy --entry google-drive
```


## Adding a server to the Registry

We re-populate the registry on a regular basis from the [seed file](https://github.com/director-run/director/tree/main/apps/registry/src/seed/entries.ts). If you'd like to add a new entry, please add it to the file and open a PR. Here's an example of an entry:

```js
  {
    name: "notion",
    title: "Notion",
    description:
      "Connect to Notion API, enabling advanced automation and interaction capabilities for developers and tools.",
    isOfficial: true,
    icon: "https://registry.director.run/notion.svg",
    homepage: "https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server",
    transport: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      env: {
        OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS:
          '{"Authorization": "Bearer <notion-bearer-token>", "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28" }',
      },
    },
    parameters: [
      {
        name: "notion-bearer-token",
        description:
          "Get a bearer token from [Notion Settings](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)",
        type: "string",
        required: true,
        password: true,
      },
    ],
  }
```

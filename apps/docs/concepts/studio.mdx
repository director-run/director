The [Studio](https://studio.director.run), along with the [CLI](./cli), are the primary ways to interact with director. The easiest way to get started is to run `director quickstart` which will start the gateway and open the studio in your browser.

# Usage

```bash
$ npm install -g @director.run/cli
$ director serve # start the gateway
$ director studio # open the studio - https://studio.director.run
```

We currently have an experimental Docker image that you can use to run the gateway in a containerized environment. This functionality is experimental and may change in the future.

```bash
# Start the gateway container, listening on port 8080
# Mount the data directory to persist the gateway's state (config files, etc)
docker run \
        -d -p 8080:8080 \
        -v ./data:/root/.director \
        --name director \
        director/gateway:latest

# Tail the logs
docker logs -f director

# Interact with the gateway using the CLI, on the host machine
GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8080 director create my-proxy
GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8080 director add my-proxy --entry fetch
```

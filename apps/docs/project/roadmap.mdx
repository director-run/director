Below is our tentative roadmap for the next few months. We're actively working on the following:

#### Now
- **Launch MVP**: ensure the MVP is working as expected. Onboard users manually, and fix any bugs that come up.

#### Next

- **oAuth**: Support authentication with oAuth. On both the client and server side of the gateway.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple tenants in the same director instance.

#### Later

- **Hosting**: Support for hosting director instances in the cloud.
- **Plugins**: Support for plugins to extend the functionality of director.

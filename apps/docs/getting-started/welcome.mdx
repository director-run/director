[Director](https://director.run) is a fully open source MCP middleware that simplifies MCP server integration and deployment. It's MCP native (with support for all transports), and sits between your model (or agent) and the underlying MCP servers. It implements a proxy pattern to, on the server side, aggragate all tools, prompts and resources and on the client side, abstract the complexity away and provide a simple, clean and static integration point. This allows you to delegate the management of your MCP servers entirely, so that you can focus on what matters most: the prompt and the domain logic. In a nutshell, the benefits are as follows:

#### Open Source
MIT-licensed with no vendor lock-in. Run locally with zero dependencies, in Docker, or as a cloud service.
#### Centralized Configuration
Eliminate client-side config files and secret management. Create isolated proxies with dedicated connection endpoints.
#### Protocol-Native
Fully MCP-compliant implementation that works with any standard MCP client or server.
#### Flexible Deployment
Install and run locally in one command via npm. Deploy to any *nix server or containerized environment.
#### Built-in Observability
Structured JSON logging for all MCP operations. Stream logs to your existing aggregation tools for production monitoring.
#### Security Features
- VM Isolation: Sandbox MCP servers in VMs or containers to prevent code injection
- OAuth2 Support (coming soon): Automated token management and secure authentication
- Multi-tenancy (coming soon): Transform single-tenant MCP servers into multi-tenant deployments
#### MCP Registry
Discover and evaluate MCP servers securely with built-in isolation. Future releases will enable dynamic server management through MCP tool calls.

# Prerequisites

- This is only tested on MacOS and Linux (TODO).
- You'll need `node` / `npm` installed.
- You'll need `uvx` for most of the servers. 
- You'll need Claude, Cursor or VSCode installed if you want director to connect to them automatically.


# Quickstart

The fastest way to try director is to use run the quickstart flow via `npx`. This will run the latest version of director and open up the studio in your browser.

```bash
npx @director/cli quickstart
```

# Alternative Methods

## Installing Locally

If you'd like to install director locally, you can do so via `npm`.

```bash
npm install -g @director/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director studio # open the studio in your browser
```

## Getting started with the CLI

If you'd like to set up director without going through the UI, you can do so via the CLI. If you'd like to see a more detailed example, you can check out the [CLI Reference](../sdk/cli).

```bash
npm install -g @director/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director create my-first-proxy # create a proxy
director add fetch --target=my-first-proxy # add the fetch server to the proxy
director connect my-first-proxy --target=claude # connect the proxy to Claude
director connect my-first-proxy --target=cursor # connect the proxy to Cursor
director connect my-first-proxy # print the manual connection details
```

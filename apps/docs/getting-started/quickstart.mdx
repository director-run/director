# Start the Director Service

The core functionality of Director is a web service that sits between MCP clients and servers. Use the command below to start it:

```bash
director serve
```

# Create & Connect to Your First Proxy

## Option 1: Via the GUI

We provide a GUI, called studio that allows you to manage the service easily. It’s available at https://studio.director.run, you can also open it with the command below.

```bash
director studio 
```

## Option 2: Via the CLI

If you prefer, you can also use the command line to manage director. It’s functionally equivalent to the GUI.

### Create a Proxy Server

Proxies are MCP servers that encapsulate any number of other MCP servers. All MCP server specific configuration (environment variables, secrets, arguments..) is encapsulated within each proxy server.

```bash
director create my-first-proxy
```

### Add an MCP Server to the Proxy

```bash
# Add the fetch server from the director registry
director add fetch --target=my-first-proxy

# Add any server you want
director add --target=my-first-proxy
```

### Connect the Proxy Server to your Client

```bash
# connect the proxy to Claude
director connect my-first-proxy --target=claude

# connect the proxy to Cursor
director connect my-first-proxy --target=claude

# print the manual connection details
director connect my-first-proxy
```

## Why Director?

Director is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) proxy server that simplifies the management of multiple MCP connections. Instead of manually configuring each client to connect to individual MCP servers, Director acts as a central hub that:

- üîå Unified Connection Management: Single endpoint for all clients with multiple backend MCP servers (`proxy:ls` to view)
- üöÄ Client Integration: One-command installation to Claude/Cursor (`install <proxyId> -c [claude|cursor]`)
- üîç Registry Discovery: Browse and install MCP servers from GitHub (`registry:ls` to discover, `registry:get` to inspect)
- üìã Protocol Compliance: Full MCP spec implementation with SSE and stdio transport support
- üõ°Ô∏è Proxy Isolation: Independent contexts prevent cross-contamination between proxies
- ‚ö° Simplified Setup: One-command proxy creation and configuration (`proxy:create <name>`)
- üìä Audit Trails: Configurable logging with request tracking and error handling
- üîí Security: Secure transports, error isolation, and configurable security settings


## Quickstart

*Note: Director is new project under active development and is not yet stable. See CONTRIBUTING.md.*

```shell
# install director
$ npm install -g @openai/codex

# start the server (-d deamonizes)
$ director start -d

# create a new proxy server
$ director proxy:create <PROXY_NAME>

# list available servers
$ director registry:ls

# add a target from the registry 
$ director proxy:target:create <PROXY_ID> <TARGET_NAME>

# install the proxy server to claude
$ director claude:install <PROXY_ID>
```

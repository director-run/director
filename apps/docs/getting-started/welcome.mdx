[Director](https://director.run) is a fully open source MCP middleware that simplifies MCP server integration and deployment. It's MCP native (with support for all transports), and sits between your model (or agent) and the underlying MCP servers. It implements a proxy pattern to, on the server side, aggragate all tools, prompts and resources and on the client side, abstract the complexity away and provide a simple, clean and static integration point. This allows you to delegate the management of your MCP servers entirely, so that you can focus on what matters most: the prompt and the domain logic. In a nutshell, the benefits are as follows:

#### No vendor lockin or hidden fees
Director is 100% Open Source and licenced under MIT. This includes our CLI, the UI and our registry. We’ve designed director so you can easily run on your own machine (with 0 external dependecies), in a docker container or as a long running service in the cloud.
#### Configuration & Secret Management
You no longer need to maintain large config files at each client end point that contain implementation specificities & secrets. Director allows you to create any number of proxies that are isolated from one another and can be integrated with via a single connection point (MCP Streamable, Stdio or SSE). 

#### Protocol Transparency
Director’s design is fully aligned with the MCP protocol. Ultimately, it’s just another MCP server that "just works" with any MCP client or server. If you're already familiar with MCP, you can start using Director in minutes.

#### Run locally and deploy in Cloud
You can try director on your own machine in minutes. No account needed, it's one line to install and run locally. You can deploy in the cloud using our docker image (coming soon), or just install it via `npm` and run it on any *nix server.

#### Multi-tenancy (coming soon)

#### Observability
Director provides detailed JSON logging for all MCP calls. In production, you can easily drain these into your existing log aggregation tool. In development, this helps you debug what’s going on.

#### Security / Isolation
Director makes it really easy to isolate MCP servers inside a docker container or a VM. All you need to do is install director itself within the container and then interact with it as if it were local using the CLI.

#### Authentication (coming soon)
Director also fronts authentication for you. You can oauth to each of your servers once and then director will manage this for you.

#### Server Routing & Discovery
Although our long term ambition is not to host and manage our own registry . While we wait for the official Registry SDK, our internal registry make it super easy to discover and try MCP servers in a secure way (coupled with isolation). Going forward, we aim to build a Director MCP server that will allow the MCP client to discover, configure and enable servers through MCP tool calls (MCP inception - see roadmap).

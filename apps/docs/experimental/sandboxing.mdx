The Stdio transport is inherently insecure, as it runs unsigned code from the internet. The VM sandbox allows you to isolate this code within an virtual machine which protects your system from remote code execution attacks. Find out more about the sandboxing feature in the [Director VM Sandbox](https://github.com/theworkingcompany/director/tree/main/apps/sandbox) repository.


## Quick Start

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
brew install ansible
brew install sshpass
```

#### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theworkingcompany/director.git
cd apps/sandbox
```

#### 3. Create & Provision a Sandbox

```bash
# Create a new VM named 'my-sandbox' and start it
bun cli create my-sandbox --start

# Provision the VM with ansible
bun cli provision my-sandbox

# SSH into your VM
bun cli ssh my-sandbox

```


#### 4. Start the Director Service

Inside the VM:

```bash
# Navigate to the shared directory
cd shared/director

# Start the Director service
bun cli serve
```

#### 5. Connect from Host

On your host machine:

```bash
# Connect to the VM sandbox through the gateway
GATEWAY_URL=http://my-sandbox.local:3673 bun cli connect my-proxy -t claude
```
